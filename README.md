ðŸ§© README Summary â€“ SQL Joins
This project provides a practical overview of SQL Joins, demonstrating how to combine data from two or more tables based on related columns. SQL joins are essential in relational databases for retrieving meaningful information from connected datasets. The repository includes detailed examples and queries for each join type:
â€¢	INNER JOIN â€“ Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
â€¢	LEFT JOIN â€“ Returns all rows from the left table, and the matching rows from the right table. Unmatched rows on the right appear as NULL.
â€¢	RIGHT JOIN â€“ Returns all rows from the right table, and the matching rows from the left table. Unmatched rows on the left appear as NULL.
â€¢	FULL OUTER JOIN â€“ Combines results of both left and right joins, returning all records with NULLs where matches are missing on either side.
â€¢	CROSS JOIN â€“ Produces the Cartesian product of both tables, pairing every row from the first table with every row from the second.
The goal of this project is to help learners and analysts understand how data relationships work across multiple tables. Itâ€™s suitable for practicing and visualizing SQL join concepts in Databricks SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any standard database environment.
